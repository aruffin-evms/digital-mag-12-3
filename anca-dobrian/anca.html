          <p>Imagine a large city with a network of highways, each road bustling with motorists streaming in all
            directions. Now, imagine that your job is to track each vehicle, discern its cargo, determine which drivers
            are up to no good and then stop them before they do any harm.</p>
          <p>Sound difficult? That’s essentially the task facing scientist <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/anca-d-dobrian.php">Anca Dobrian, PhD</a>, Professor of 
            <a href="https://www.evms.edu/physiological_sciences/">Physiological Sciences</a> and Master Educator in the <a href="https://www.evms.edu/about_evms/administrative_offices/faculty_affairs/fine_family_academy_of_educators/">Fine Family Academy of Educators</a> at EVMS. But instead of trucks or cars,
            Dr. Dobrian’s prey are tiny biological elements known as extracellular vesicles. And rather than searching
            on highways, her pursuit takes place in the human body.</p>
          <p>For decades, these vesicles that circulate outside cells were discounted as little more than cellular trash
            collectors. But recent discoveries demonstrate that extracellular vesicles actually are vital cogs in a
            complex communications machinery — shuttling messages and biological cargo between cells throughout the
            body.</p>

They then use an imaging flow cytometer to help them separate and analyze each component.</figcaption>

        <div class="story-template__copy">
          <p>Understanding how they work could be the key to unlocking treatments for a range of diseases.</p>
          <p>“At any one time there are billions of them circulating in the body,” Dr. Dobrian says. “They have been found in all the body fluids from tears to sweat to urine to blood.”</p>        
          <p>Dr. Dobrian’s cellular detective work has long focused on finding a way to prevent the unhealthy side
            effects of obesity — among them diabetes and heart and vascular disease. More recently, her studies have
            broadened to include liver disease and prostate cancer.
            And with each disease she adds to her research, Dr. Dobrian has come to believe that vesicles play an
            important role.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="story-template__copy">
          <p>Her research has shown that vesicles have an affinity for certain types of cells. For instance, vesicles
            produced by fat cells tend to migrate to cells and promote atherosclerosis or liver fibrosis.</p>
          <p>“If the vesicles are damaging, how can we prevent their uptake by the tissue?” she asks. “To do that, we
            have to understand the mechanism by which they are taken up and then maybe we can inhibit that.</p>
          <p>“I’m hoping there is something in common that explains the unhealthy side effects of obesity,” she says.
            “And I’m hoping that by looking at these cellular messengers we can understand that commonality.”</p>
          <p>If her detective work pays off, understanding those commonalities might help take harmful vesicles off the
            cellular highway.</p>
