        <p class="street-health__intro__p">“I don’t really keep up with my health,” says Mr. Stokes, 62, of Norfolk,
          who lacks health insurance, is on disability and was
          homeless for three years. He’s attending a free EVMS Street Health clinic “to get everything checked out.”

        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Street Health, like all of the <a
            href="https://www.evms.edu/education/resources/community-engaged_learning/"
            target="_blank">Community-Engaged Learning</a> initiatives
          at EVMS, integrates community service with structured
          learning. Students venture out of the classroom and sharpen skills through practical experiences as they
          tackle health
          needs in the community.</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Street Health launched during the 2018-19 school year, led by Andy
          Abayan, now a third-year medical student. Under the
          supervision of a physician, students conduct health screenings for people experiencing homelessness,
          provide referrals for
          follow-ups and collect data for continuity of care.</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">He was inspired by the three years he had volunteered with Doctors
          Without Walls in his hometown of Santa Barbara,
          California. The group holds clinics in parks to deliver healthcare to people living on the streets.</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">“I had the most wonderful experience working with that population,”
          Mr. Abayan recalls. “We’re all one step away from
          being in their situation. A lot of them had one bad thing happen and they couldn’t get themselves out of
          it.”</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">That experience, he says, not only fueled his desire to practice
          emergency medicine, it inspired him to pitch the idea for Street
          Health to <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/don-g-robison.php" target="_blank">Don Robison,
            PhD</a>, Director for Community-Engaged Learning. “We’re such a community-oriented
          school,” Mr.
          Abayan says. People experiencing homelessness “are part of our community.”</p>

        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Katherine Schaffer and Fatmata Conteh, both of the MD Class of 2022,
          are the current co-leaders for Street Health. “Our goal
          is to bring basic primary care to those who have the greatest barrier,” Ms. Schaffer says, “and to create
          relationships and
          build future trust with physicians.”</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Ms. Conteh became involved in Street Health because she wanted
          hands-on experience. Before medical school, she
          worked as a rehabilitation counselor for adults with mental health disorders, some of whom did not have
          homes. She says
          the clinics can treat people who would otherwise have to go to the emergency room and incur bills they
          can’t pay. “It’s a
          vulnerable population that falls through the cracks very easily,” she adds.</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Street Health holds a free clinic at Freemason Baptist Church on the
          fourth Saturday of the month. That coincides with a
          free community lunch the church provides. [editor’s note: These activities were suspended when the COVID-19
          pandemic struck.] During the winter, Street Health partners with the Norfolk
          Emergency Shelter
          Team, or NEST, to hold free health clinics at NEST shelter sites. NEST is the City of Norfolk’s program
          through which churches
          provide meals and shelter for single adults who are experiencing homelessness.</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Typically, Ms. Schaffer says, about 20 people attend the clinics at
          the church. All have their vitals checked; about half
          undergo more thorough examinations. Many of the patients at the clinic are repeat visitors.</p>

        <p class="street-health__intro__p"><span class="street-health__first-letter">O</span>n the fourth Saturday of
          January, Ms. Schaffer wasn’t expecting to see many patients because the weather
          was nice. But the clinic ended up taking care of about 25 patients over two hours.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">A couple of people already were waiting out front when a white EVMS van
          arrived at the church and
          students began unloading supplies. The clinic would be ready to open in 30 minutes.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">Moving quickly up and down a hallway, Ms. Schaffer assigned team partners and
          their duties. The hallway
          was set up with a check-in station and several examination areas.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">A large, round table was loaded with pain relievers, decongestants, antacids,
          vitamins, fungal creams, bandages and other
          supplies to share with patients as needed. Street Health students also were ready to hand out donated clothing
          and pass
          out watches to patients to help them get to follow-up appointments on time.</p>

          assess potential problems, such as vision loss from
          diabetes. Alan Wagner, MD (Ophthalmology Residency ’86), founder of the practice, is well aware of the need
          for this care
          — he is an EVMS alumnus and member of the school’s <a
            href="https://www.evms.edu/about_evms/leadership/board_of_visitors/" target="_blank">Board of Visitors</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">On this day, 22 students helped conduct the clinic, supervised by a
          surgeon, a psychiatrist and Dr. Gavin Rogers. Dr. Rogers
          assisted with Street Health while he was a student. Now he’s back to offer guidance.</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Dr. Rogers says emergency rooms treat a lot of people experiencing
          homelessness because many don’t have health
          insurance or primary care physicians. And not trusting the healthcare system, many avoid seeking care until
          their conditions
          deteriorate.</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">“This program gives us a chance to meet people,” he says, “get to
          know them, build trust in the community and provide
          them with preventative and primary care, so they don’t end up in the ER.”</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Street Health patients have presented conditions ranging from
          strains, sprains, fractures and wounds to urinary tract
          infections and high blood pressure to diabetes and HIV, he says. “It’s a bit like the ER. We see a little of
          everything.”</p>

            href="https://www.evms.edu/internal_medicine/strelitz_diabetes_center/" target="_blank">EVMS Strelitz
            Diabetes Center</a>, volunteered her time at the clinic to train the
          students to screen patients for high cholesterol and diabetes.</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">“I’m a big proponent of knowing your numbers,” Ms. Kuhn says, such as
          A1C, a blood test that measures average blood
          glucose levels.</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">“Once you know your numbers, we can do something for you,” Ms. Kuhn
          says. “This is a way for us to be able to help people
          who basically cannot afford to go to see a doctor. We can provide information and refer them to outreach
          centers that can
          help them get the healthcare they need.”</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Diabetes, she says, is especially important to diagnose and control
          because it can affect all aspects of life, such as
          contributing to vision loss and heart and circulatory problems.</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Ms. Kuhn’s mother died from complications from diabetes, which
          inspired her passion for diabetes education. “I don’t
          want anyone to ever have to go through what I went through. If I can help this small group of people, then
          I’ve made a
          difference.”</p>

          cholesterol.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">Patients with chronic conditions like diabetes then visit with a team of EVMS
          students. The students present their
          findings to the doctors who weigh in and go back to the patient with the team for further assessments if
          needed.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">Mr. Stokes pedaled over to the church from his new home nearby to come to
          what he believed to be his fifth or six Street Health
          clinic. He says he hopes the Street Health clinics will continue indefinitely to help more people like him.
          Living on the streets, he
          adds, can lead to despair, depression and sickness.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">Mr. Stokes had been living with and taking care of his ill parents. Then the
          family home was sold, and he found himself with nowhere to go.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">“I went from a three-story house to a park bench in three weeks,” he says. He
          slept on sidewalks for about three years until he found housing with help from Norfolk Redevelopment and
          Housing Authority.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">Parish Hodge, 48, of Norfolk, came to Freemason Baptist Church with a friend
          to attend the free lunch. Mr. Hodge, who says he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and has been
          homeless for about six months, is staying temporarily at a Salvation Army shelter.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">When Mr. Hodge saw the EVMS van, he was inspired to go to the clinic to have
          his foot examined for a pulled muscle. The Street Health team gave him Motrin to alleviate the pain.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">“They were really nice and really respectful,” says Mr. Hodge, who plans to
          return to the clinic when he can get to the church.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">Ollie Celestin, 51, of Norfolk, also had the free lunch in mind when he
          visited the church. Intrigued when he spied medical students, he decided to check up on his health and get an
          eye exam. This was his first time at a Street Health clinic. He was the first in line.</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">“We basically helped each other today,” Mr. Celestin says of the EVMS
          students. “I just needed to know about my health more than anything.”</p>
        <p class="street-health__intro__p">Mr. Celestin has been homeless since just before Christmas and staying in
          NEST shelters. He says he has conquered a drug addiction and is optimistic that his living situation will

        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Ms. Schaffer adds that helping serve the church breakfast is a way to
          make connections with people face-to-face, “not
          just as a physician who wants to poke and prod you.”</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">Creating those relationships builds trust, she says. She’s had some
          people she’s met at breakfast later see her at a clinic
          and seek her advice.</p>
        <p class="street-health__qoute-section__p">“We get to meet them where they are,” she says. “We get to see them
          not just as patients, but as friends, colleagues,
          peers.”</p>
