        <p class="cultural-fair__p">The deep, fragrant scents of chiles, cinnamon, ginger and lemongrass filled Lester
          Hall on a Friday afternoon in February.
          The distinctive aromas represented more than a dozen traditional dishes prepared for this year’s Student
          National Medical
          Association Cultural Fair.</p>
        <p class="cultural-fair__p">The event is held each year for the entire community to celebrate the cultures at
          EVMS. “We created this event last year
          because we have a diverse class and a diverse school,” says Dominic Adams, MD Class of 2021. “We wanted a way
          to
          showcase that, and we thought food was a great way to do it.”</p>
        <p class="cultural-fair__p">While it is a food-focused event, the conversation is just as important to SNMA
          members. “The Cultural Fair provides an
          opportunity for discussion and education on race, ethnicity and culture,” says Faven Russom, MS (Medical
          Master’s ’19),
          MD Class of 2023. “These are all important subjects that allow us to become better students, physicians,
          colleagues and
          professionals.”</p>

        <p>SNMA is a national organization that aims to support underrepresented minority
          medical students, but most SNMA
          events are open to students of all backgrounds. “We welcome everyone to hear and learn about the experiences
          of
          minority students, physicians and patients,” Ms. Russom says. “Taking the time to understand the challenges
          faced by
          underrepresented populations can greatly improve the interactions and relationships we have with our patients
          and help
          us all become more culturally competent physicians.”</p>
        <p class="cultural-fair__p">The organization recently partnered with the Dermatology Club to host the first
          Melanin in Medicine conference on
          campus. Organizers wanted to bring awareness to the various skin conditions that impact individuals of all
          races and
          ethnicities.</p>
        <p class="cultural-fair__p">During the conference, students attended lectures, interactive patient panels and an
          exhibitor fair. Among the topics of
          discussion were skin, nail and hair disorders; vitiligo diagnosis and treatment; and melanoma.</p>
        <p class="cultural-fair__p">Students from Norfolk State University, College of William & Mary, Hampton
          University and Christopher Newport University
          attended the event, as well as several students from Maury High School, Bayside High School and Norfolk
          Academy.</p>
        <p class="cultural-fair__p">“Events like these are important as there is a great need to increase the number of
          racially and ethnically underrepresented
          minorities in healthcare,” says Taylor Dyson, MD Class of 2022. “Melanin in Medicine is one example of how
          EVMS is taking
          steps to increase diversity in the field of medicine, specifically dermatology.”</p>

        <p>Diversity among medical specialties was one of the main topics of discussion at the
          SNMA Region VI Leadership Institute
          hosted at EVMS in September.</p>
        <p class="cultural-fair__p">“The Regional Leadership Institute’s purpose is to build leadership among students
          in the health and pre-health professions
          programs,” says Mekbib Gemeda, Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion. “SNMA recognizes that diversity of
          professionals
          in all specialties advances excellence in healthcare and improves health outcomes.”</p>
        <p class="cultural-fair__p">During the conference, students gained new skills through clinical seminars,
          professional lectures, panels and discussions
          on various social issues.</p>
        <p class="cultural-fair__p">“We learned about leadership and how we can become competent leaders in the medical
          field,” says Stafford Brown,
          MS (Medical Master’s ’18), MD Class of 2022 and EVMS SNMA chapter President. “Oftentimes, minorities face
          additional
          struggles to obtain positions of leadership, and it’s been great to get advice that is specific to us.”</p>

          <p>In addition to conferences and seminars, the EVMS chapter of SNMA also provides
            rewarding opportunities to volunteer in
            various mentoring programs at colleges across Hampton Roads.</p>
          <p class="cultural-fair__p">“As a pre-medical student, I did not have the tools I needed to ensure success in
            the medical school application process
            or to prepare for medical school,” says Le’Nisha Williams, MD Class of 2022. “With SNMA’s strong affiliation
            with various
            undergraduate institutions, we are a resource to the students in our mentorship programs and can provide
            them with the
            tools many of us did not have.”</p>

          <p class="cultural-fair__p">For many members, SNMA is more than a club or organization — it’s a supportive and
            inclusive family that welcomes all.
            The dozens of people gathered around food from countries such as Ghana, Jamaica, Poland and the Philippines
            at the
            Cultural Fair are great examples of that community.</p>
          <p class="cultural-fair__p">“So often people forget it’s not just a race thing,” says Shammah Okai, MD Class
            of 2021, former SNMA President. “There are
            so many other ethnicities and cultures within this community that we need to highlight and celebrate, so
            what better way
            to celebrate Black History Month than with a celebration of diversity?”</p>
