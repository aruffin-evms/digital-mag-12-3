        <p class="dr-lieb__p dr-lieb__intro">On campus, <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/david-c-lieb.php" target="_blank">David Lieb, MD</a>, is Associate Professor of Internal Medicine, Director of the <a href="https://www.evms.edu/internal_medicine/fellowships/endocrinology_diabetes_and_metabolism_fellowship/" target="_blank">EVMS Endocrinology Fellowship Program</a> and patient care provider with EVMS Medical Group’s Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders practice. Off campus, Dr. Lieb is a serious collector and reader of comic books.</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p dr-lieb__question">When did you start collecting comic books and why?</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">I started reading comic books in elementary school. I loved Archie comics, Disney comics like Uncle Scrooge, and Garfield — the same stuff that my three boys read now. But I really started collecting comics when I was in middle school. I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes the summer I turned 12 and couldn’t go to camp that year — so I had a lot of time to read! That, and the Tim Burton “Batman” movie came out, and all of my friends were into it. </p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p dr-lieb__question">How many comic books do you have? Do you collect any specific kinds?</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">I probably have between 5,000 and 10,000 individual comics, along with collected editions and graphic novels. My interests have changed over time, from superhero books to slice-of-life comics to crime/noir comics. That’s one of the reasons I love comic books so much. They truly cover every genre: fiction and nonfiction, memoir and fantasy. I love comics from the silver and bronze ages of comics — the ’60s and ’70s — especially Marvel comics. </p>

              “When I was a kid, my favorite characters
              were Spider-Man and Batman. I couldn’t
              get enough of them. Now I’ll often get
              into a particular writer or artist and
              then collect a lot of their work rather
              than focus on one character.”</p>

        </div>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p dr-lieb__question">Are any of them valuable? Are you on the hunt for any special ones?</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">I don’t have too many super-valuable comics. As a kid from the ’80s and ’90s, I have a few popular books from that era. My first appearance of Deadpool is worth something. Most of the older books I have are “reader copies.” They may not be in the best condition, but I can read and enjoy them. Some collectors put their books in hard plastic containers and have them professionally graded. That’s never been my thing. I like to hold them and read them.</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p dr-lieb__question">Do you have a favorite character? What else should we know about your collection?</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">When I was a kid, my favorite characters were Spider-man and Batman. I couldn’t get enough of them. Now I’ll often get into a particular writer or artist and then collect a lot of their work, rather than focus on one character. One of my favorite creators is Jack Kirby, the “King of Comics.” Kirby created or co-created almost every major Marvel character, including Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, the Eternals — you name it. He went on to create a series at rival DC comics called the Fourth World with characters that include Orion and Darkseid. It’s a shame he didn’t live to see all of his creations on the big screen. I have two comics signed by Jack. They are two of my most prized possessions. </p>

        <p class="dr-lieb__p dr-lieb__question">What are the most common misconceptions about comic books and/or their collectors?</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">The “Comic Book Guy” from the Simpsons comes to mind. And of course, that guy does exist.  But everyone reads comics: kids, adults, girls, boys, women, men, and they are international and cover every genre. I have comics that have moved me to tears and comics that have shown me what it’s like to live in someone else’s shoes. It’s not all superheroes. </p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p dr-lieb__question">You’ve been with EVMS for more than 10 years now. What keeps you here?</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">I love the people at EVMS. From my patients to my colleagues across the school to the medical students, residents and fellows — it’s the people I get to work with who mean the most to me. EVMS is special. It’s small enough that I had significant career opportunities I would not have had at other institutions, but large enough that I’ve found wonderful people to collaborate with on so many projects over the years. I also love Norfolk, and it doesn’t hurt that we have the world’s best comic shop less than a mile from my house — shout out to Local Heroes in Ghent!</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p dr-lieb__question">What are you most passionate about in your work at EVMS?</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">My professional passions are patient-care clinical education. It’s my patients and our endocrinology fellows that keep me smiling at work every day. </p>
