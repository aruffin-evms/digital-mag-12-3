        <p class="dr-lieb__p">The deep, fragrant scents of chiles, cinnamon, ginger and lemongrass filled Lester Hall on
          a Friday afternoon in February.
          The distinctive aromas represented more than a dozen traditional dishes prepared for this year’s Student
          National Medical
          Association Cultural Fair.</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">The event is held each year for the entire community to celebrate the cultures at EVMS.
          “We created this event last year
          because we have a diverse class and a diverse school,” says Dominic Adams, MD Class of 2021. “We wanted a way
          to
          showcase that, and we thought food was a great way to do it.”</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">While it is a food-focused event, the conversation is just as important to SNMA members.
          “The Cultural Fair provides an
          opportunity for discussion and education on race, ethnicity and culture,” says Faven Russom, MS (Medical
          Master’s ’19),
          MD Class of 2023. “These are all important subjects that allow us to become better students, physicians,
          colleagues and
          professionals.”</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">SNMA is a national organization that aims to support underrepresented minority medical
          students, but most SNMA
          events are open to students of all backgrounds. “We welcome everyone to hear and learn about the experiences
          of
          minority students, physicians and patients,” Ms. Russom says. “Taking the time to understand the challenges
          faced by
          underrepresented populations can greatly improve the interactions and relationships we have with our patients
          and help
          us all become more culturally competent physicians.”</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">The organization recently partnered with the Dermatology Club to host the first Melanin in
          Medicine conference on
          campus. Organizers wanted to bring awareness to the various skin conditions that impact individuals of all
          races and
          ethnicities.</p>

              “When I was a kid, my favorite characters
              were Spider-Man and Batman. I couldn’t
              get enough of them. Now I’ll often get
              into a particular writer or artist and
              then collect a lot of their work rather
              than focus on one character.”</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">During the conference, students attended lectures, interactive patient panels and an
          exhibitor fair. Among the topics of
          discussion were skin, nail and hair disorders; vitiligo diagnosis and treatment; and melanoma.</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">Students from Norfolk State University, College of William & Mary, Hampton University and
          Christopher Newport University
          attended the event, as well as several students from Maury High School, Bayside High School and Norfolk
          Academy.</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">“Events like these are important as there is a great need to increase the number of
          racially and ethnically underrepresented
          minorities in healthcare,” says Taylor Dyson, MD Class of 2022. “Melanin in Medicine is one example of how
          EVMS is taking
          steps to increase diversity in the field of medicine, specifically dermatology.”</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">Diversity among medical specialties was one of the main topics of discussion at the SNMA
          Region VI Leadership Institute
          hosted at EVMS in September.</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">“The Regional Leadership Institute’s purpose is to build leadership among students in the
          health and pre-health professions</p>

        <p class="dr-lieb__p">“We learned about leadership and how we can become competent leaders in the medical field,” says Stafford Brown,
          MS (Medical Master’s ’18), MD Class of 2022 and EVMS SNMA chapter President. “Oftentimes, minorities face additional
          struggles to obtain positions of leadership, and it’s been great to get advice that is specific to us.”</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">In addition to conferences and seminars, the EVMS chapter of SNMA also provides rewarding opportunities to volunteer in
          various mentoring programs at colleges across Hampton Roads.</p>
        <p class="dr-lieb__p">“As a pre-medical student, I did not have the tools I needed to ensure success in the medical school application process
          or to prepare for medical school,” says Le’Nisha Williams, MD Class of 2022. “With SNMA’s strong affiliation with various
          undergraduate institutions, we are a resource to the students in our mentorship programs and can provide them with the
          tools many of us did not have.”</p>
